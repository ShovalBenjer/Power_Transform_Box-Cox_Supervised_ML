## Introduction
This project aims to provide a detailed, step-by-step guide to understanding and implementing machine learning workflows. It covers essential topics from data cleaning and feature engineering to model selection and hyperparameter tuning.

## Data Preprocessing
The data preprocessing section includes techniques for handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling features, and splitting the dataset into training and test sets.

## Model Building
This section demonstrates how to build various machine learning models, including linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and more. Each model is implemented with detailed explanations.

## Model Evaluation
We evaluate the performance of the models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The evaluation includes visualizations to help understand the strengths and weaknesses of each model.

## Conclusion
The conclusion summarizes the findings and provides insights into the best practices for machine learning projects.
